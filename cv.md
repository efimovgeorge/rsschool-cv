My main goal is to be a good person.  
My strong point (working) is the left one (as in the photo).  
I sometimes do my own projects - I develop websites.  
Phew, Markdown has been added to my skills. Or not.  

***I even registered on https://www.codewars.com:***
```JavaScript
function multiply(a, b){
return  a * b
} 
```
My most interesting project for today (March 1, 2022):

Where did I study?  
I studied at the Vorovsky Institute on Faculty of Pocket Traction.  
My English is bad. И огорчений.
